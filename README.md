<div id="header" >
 <h1 class="heading-element" dir="auto">How It's Made</h1>
 Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript , Mongodb , Express<br/>
 For this application I implemented both MongDB and Express to handle the back-end. The focus was
 to create a fullstack app with the ability to create a note through an input. Each note is saved to a database and removed once the
 user deletes it.

<div id="header" >
 <h1 class="heading-element" dir="auto">Optimizations</h1>
 Create a login so users notes are saved to their profile. Also I would create a edit button. Finally I would focus on
 a React Native build for mobile use.

 <h1 class="heading-element" dir="auto">Lessons Learned</h1>
 I lesson learned was when manipulating the database information use CRUD(create , read , update , delete).
 Each dependency needs to be installed for each individual application also ensure each dependency is updated.
